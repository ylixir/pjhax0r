## Getting and building:

First you need to get the Github Desktop client [from here](https://desktop.github.com). After installing click the "+" at the top left, choose clone and this repository. Clone it where you like.

Second you need to set up your IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Android studio has the simplest setup and instructions for it are [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Setting-up-your-Development-Environment-%28Eclipse%2C-Intellij-IDEA%2C-NetBeans%29#setting-up-android-studio)

Third you need to import our game into your IDE. Instructions for Android Studio are [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gradle-and-Intellij-IDEA)

Now follow the instructions for running it on the desktop. Once you get it running it's time to play!

Try messing with MyGdxGame.java in the "core" of the project, see what happens.

## Play!
Remember you are using git, which is a kind of version control. That means you can make all the changes you want, and if you screw things up, then you can just go back to where you were. Don't be afraid to experiement.
